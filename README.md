# Unichat

An anonymous roulette-chat written by me and my friends, Rassul Rakhimzhan and Tauka, for Nazarbayev University student community. Summer 2016.<br>
The project is written using SpringMVC, our first experience with it. Enjoyed. But do not expect perfect code!<br>
The initial database data is not given for students' privacy reason.

P.S. Code is not well documented, since we never expected that one day we would love to open the code for a bigger community. But feel free to ask questions about the deployment.
